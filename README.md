# Motorsportle

A minimalist daily motorsport guessing game inspired by Cardle.uk and Wordle.

## Structure
- `/public/` — static assets (images, favicon)
- `/src/` — source code (HTML, CSS, JS)
- `/data/` — motorsport image/answer database

## Getting Started
Open `src/index.html` in your browser to play the game locally.

## Next Steps
- Add cropped motorsport images to `/public/`
- Populate `/data/challenges.json` with daily challenges
- Build out game logic in `src/app.js`
